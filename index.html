    <h2>What is the Money Bail Law?</h2>

      <p>The money bail law originated in the 1800s in England, where most people relied on friends to pay an agreed-upon amount if they failed to show up in court. This slowly shifted into the use of “secured” money bail. This provides a financial incentive for a person who has been accused of a crime — but not yet convicted — to attend court hearings at a later date. that states that if an inmate pays a certain amount of money before court, they can be released from jail.   </p>
        
        <br><p>Despite the constitution, which states that every individual is innocent until proven guilty, inmates must pay in order to secure their release before trial. This means that wealthy people charged with crimes can escape their crimes, while the average person has to remain in jail. </p>
          

        <br><p> Wealth-based detention can cause overcrowding of local jails, lost jobs, lost housing, poor medical care, broken families, and drained local budgets. In many cases, an arrestee may be held longer in jail while awaiting trial than any sentence they would likely receive if convicted. This causes innocent people to plead guilty to offenses that they did not commit in order to shorten lengthy pretrial detention. </p>
        
        <br><p>Poorer individuals are unable to assist their attorneys in the investigation of the charges against them, resulting in wrongful convictions and longer sentences. </p>
