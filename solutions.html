    <h2>Reduce people sent to jail</h2>
    
    <p> Jurisdictions can fix the problem by sending fewer people to jail and minimizing the use of pretrial detention toward making communities safer while shrinking the footprint of the criminal justice system and saving taxpayer dollars. It costs an average of about $81,000 per year to incarcerate an inmate in prison in California.
      
      <h2>Increase importance of court appearances and helping with time restraints</h2>
     
    <p>Jurisdictions can also support defendantsâ€™ successful appearance in court, such as providing court date reminders, transportation vouchers, flexible scheduling, and on-site child care. </p>

      <br><h2>Put them under probation instead</h2>
    <p> People who are convicted could also be let to not be detained pretrial unless the Judge deems it necessary. They could also waive fees for those who would be unable to pay that sum. Probation allows a person convicted of a crime the chance to remain in the community instead of going to jail. Probation requires that you comply with certain court-ordered rules and conditions under the supervision of a probation officer. </p>


    <br><p>  We as citizens should support the End Money Bail Act, letting states and governments to make the bail system more justified. The End Money Bail Act proclaims that the use of secured bonds in criminal proceedings will end. It also offers alternatives to pretrial detention, and states that still have money bail can offer funding assistance to those who are struggling to pay. </p>
