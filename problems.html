    <h2> What are problems with the Money Bail Law? </h2> 

      <p>The Current Money Bail Law causes a divide in the public. People with more money are able to pay off their bail whereas those with lower incomes are unable to. Since there are many more people with lower incomes than those who can afford the bails, jails have also started to become clogged. With more average people who did not commit serious crimes in these jails, space is not left for those who may have needed a more severe prison sentence. </p>
    
    <h2> Negative effects:</h2>
      <p> The Bail system criminalizes poverty by allowing the rich to escape their crimes while the poor are left to await trial. Spending days in jail can result in job losses, housing, not being able to care for their children, and losing contact with loved ones. </p>
        
        <br><p> Being held pretrial makes both conviction and incarceration more likely: people held pretrial are more likely to plead guilty simply to put an end to their case, with the hopes of returning home, and judges are statistically more likely to sentence someone to jail once they have been held in jail pretrial. </p>
        
        <br><p>This means that people held on money bail are more likely to be convicted and sentenced because they donâ€™t have readily available cash to hand over. Most people held pretrial are not dangerous: around 68% of pretrial detainees have been charged only with drug, property, or public order crimes.This system actually increases crime rates because innocent people who never committed the crime in the first place are left in poverty after paying a large amount of bail. </p>

         <br><p>Bails are also a racial issue; according to the Vera Institution of Justice, "the rate of booking bail-eligible black people into jail was nine times that of white people when controlling for population size." Combined with the fact that Black and Latino people are assigned 35% and 19% respectively higher bail amounts than whites, this contributes to the problems with jail sentencing and innocence. </p>
